# RoadRestrictionFeed Object (GeoJSON FeatureCollection)
The `RoadRestrictionFeed` object is the root (highest level) object of a TDx road restriction feed. There is one `RoadRestrictionFeed` object per road restriction feed GeoJSON document. The `RoadRestrictionFeed` is a [GeoJSON FeatureCollection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3).

The `RoadRestrictionFeed` contains information about sections of roadways that have restrictions. Restriction types described by this specification are listed in the [RestrictionType](/spec-content/enumerated-types/RestrictionType.md) enumerated type.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Conformance | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
`feed_info` | [FeedInfo](/spec-content/objects/FeedInfo.md) | Information about the TDx road restriction feed. | Required | This is a TDx-specific [foreign member](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-6.1) and is not part of the GeoJSON specification.
`type` | String; `"FeatureCollection"` | The GeoJSON object type. For TDx, this must be the string `FeatureCollection`. | Required | This is a GeoJSON property.
`features` | Array; \[[RoadEventFeature](/spec-content/objects/RoadEventFeature.md)\] | An array of GeoJSON [Feature](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) objects which represent TDx road events. | Required |
`bbox` | GeoJSON [Bounding Box](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-5) | Information on the coordinate range for all RoadEventFeatures in the TDx feed. Must be an array of length 2*n where n is the number of dimensions represented in the contained geometries, with all axes of the most southwesterly point followed by all axes of the more northeasterly point.  The axes order of a bbox follows the axes order of geometries. | Optional | This is a GeoJSON property.

## Used By
Road Restriction GeoJSON document (one `RoadRestrictionFeed` object per file).
